*Open source Software (OSS)* is software with publicily available source code, allowing anyone to inspect, modify, and enhance it 

**Key principles:**
- **Freedom to use**: No restriction on usage.
- **Freedom to study**: Access to source code.
- **Freedom to modify**: Change the code to suit your needs.
- **Freedom to Share**: Distribute your versions.

Linux is licensed under the **GNU general Public License (GPL)**, which ensures this freedom.
